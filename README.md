# Hello welcome to Lakiitu Github page!

What is Lakiitu?
Lakiitu is a high-end, console-like gaming frontend designed to centralize emulation, cloud gaming, media, and community into one seamless experience. Built with a focus on speed, aesthetics, and user immersion, Lakiitu eliminates the need for multiple launchers by providing a single, consistent interface. Lakiitu will be the first cross-platform frontend with the core target about aesthetics.
