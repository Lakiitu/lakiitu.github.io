# Hello welcome to Lakiitu Frontend 
What is Lakiitu?

Lakiitu is a frontend emulator designed to launch online ROMs, integrate cloud gaming services, and support many more features currently in development.
Its goal is to unify gaming and entertainment experiences into one simple, cross-platform interface.

Why was this project created?

Short answer: there aren’t many good cross-platform solutions available, and many existing projects take a very long time to release or mature.

Lakiitu was created to offer a faster, more flexible alternative—built with modern needs in mind and focused on accessibility across platforms.
